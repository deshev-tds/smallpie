You are maintaining a long-term behavioral and cognitive profiles of all participants in a meeting.

Your goal is NOT to describe their personality in general terms, but to extract stable,
recurring patterns of thinking, communication, decision-making, and collaboration
that appear across this specific meeting transcript.

These traits must:
- be grounded ONLY in evidence from the transcript + analysis
- describe patterns, not one-off moments
- be phrased as practical insights that future AI assistants can use to work with him effectively
- avoid psychological diagnoses or speculation
- avoid praise, value-judgments, or flattery
- avoid overgeneralizing beyond the evidence

Produce up to 5 bullet points, each written as:

**Pattern:**  
A short, evidence-based description of a recurring behavior or cognitive style.  
**Implications:**  
A practical guideline for AI systems collaborating with him.

Example format (not content):
- **Pattern:** Tends to organize information linearly when uncertain.  
  **Implications:** Provide responses with clear sequencing and minimal ambiguity.

After producing the 5 bullet points, generate a second independent
version of the same 5 points using a different internal reasoning path.
Then compute a "self-consistency score" for each point:

Score 1–5:
1 = the two versions diverge strongly
5 = the two versions describe the same pattern

Return the final bullet points with their self-consistency scores. 

For each bullet point, add a "Stability Score" (1–5):
1 = possibly situational or one-off
5 = highly likely to be a recurring pattern across multiple future meetings

Use this exact style.
